## Overview
This project aims to predict the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) based on transaction history and customer demographics. It uses regression models to estimate future CLV.

## Objectives:
- Predict the lifetime value of a customer based on transaction history.
- Use regression models to estimate the CLV.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Regression Models
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Key Insights
- Built a model to estimate the lifetime value of customers.
- Used regression models to predict future revenue from customers.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to predict CLV.
